# Classic Stock Charts in Python

This project aims at creating classic
technical analysis stock charts in Python.
The library is built around the excellent 
[matplotlib](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib)
and depends otherwize only on
[pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas). If you have
[ta-lib](https://github.com/mrjbq7/ta-lib)
installed you can also use its abstract functions as indicators but it is not a requirement. 
The interface is declarative, based on a set of drawing primitives
like `Candleststicks`, `Volume`, `Peaks`
and technical indicators
like `SMA`, `EMA`, `RSI`, `ROC`, `MACD`, etc ...
